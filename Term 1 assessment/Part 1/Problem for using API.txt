Problem for using API?:

Problem statement: What are some API that can cause lower performance to a game?

(I wont be covering this two)
-forcing players to use Legacy version due to the lack of update
- Some times, the Api could be failing when developers using. 

- Some of the Unity API could be deprecated which mean that your code might fail at some point in time due to the lack of support.
- some of the Unity API are very inefficient like the FindGameObjectsWithTag.
- There are API that can Trigger Garbage collection events

Types of API:
- FindGameObjectByTag() / FindGameObjectByType()
- SendMessage()
- Extern Call Caching
- Order of Operation
- Physics.OverlapSphereNonAlloc


Root cause of problem:

- Extern calls (Going to C++ to get reference)

- Use of computationally expensive methods (math.sqrt)

- Trade off. having no allocated memory in exchange for lower performance.

FindGameObjectsWithTag:
- still searching but I cant find github reference of this

Approach to resolve the problem:

-Try to use some optimization tricks like

FindGameObjectWithTag: should try to be used in the start/ awake call instead of the Update call because it is very slow.

- consider the trade off the function.
